TryHackMe Kenobi

In this room, I used the Linux terminal to gain information about Kenobi's machine. First I used Nmap to see how many ports were open and then used the SMBclient. I had to find the version of ProFTPd and find the exploits for that verison. I found Kenobi's private key and moved it and mounted it and found the flag in the user.txt file. Eventually, I was able to gain root access in Kenobi's machine and find the flag in the root.txt file.

Week 7 March 12th 2022
Keybase Lab

After downloading Keybase for Windows, my partner and I encrypted messages and decrypted them. I sent a decrypted message to my partner and my partner sent one back. I had to download the Saltpack file and drag it into the decryption part. It gave me .txt file I was able to open in Notepad and view the message. It was pretty entertaining receiving and sending encrypted messages.

Week 6 March 5th 2022
Encryption - Crypto 101

In this TryHackMe room, I learned about symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data, while asymmetric encryption uses a separate key for encrypting and decrypting. The room also briefly went over the Modulo operator and I had to use Python to find the answer. Another cool thing we went over was certificates and had to check the certificate for the TryHackMe website.

Week 5 Feb 25 2022
Mobile Malware Analysis

In the Mobile Malware Analysis room, I used a virtual machine to use the MOBsf tool to find information about a file. With MOBsf, I was able to see permissions, the hash, and security threats. I also used VirusTotal.com for more information about the file such as the history and type of file as well as comments from the community. With these tools, I was asked to find package names, SHA-1 signatures and name of the sample. The first file that was anaylzed was malware and the second was Pegasus.

In this TryHackMe room, I leanred about OSINT and how to go about finding information about websites. Recommended websites included lookup.icann.org, archive.org and viewdns.info. I was able to find IP addresses, nameservers, and overall history of the website.

![TryHackMe Common Attacks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98351643/153657413-79e37be1-0869-4656-a7df-0dd1fe08bfc1.jpg)


In this weeks TryHackMe room (Common Attacks), I went over many different ways our data can be stolen and how are computer can be compromised. Social engineering/phishing are two big ways attackers can steal your information. If an email looks suspicious, do not click on links and do not respond with personal information. There are a few different ways to tell if an email is a phishing scam or legit. To keep our accounts secure, it's recommended to use a password manager. Reusing the same password for multiple accounts, makes your accounts more vulnerable to attacks. It's best to have long and nonsensical passwords. You should not be able to memorize all your passwords. To keep your computer safe make sure your PC is up to date on patches and anit virus software.

For this first room on TryHackMe, I read about the basics of Cyber Security and the different career paths in the field. There are many different careers in the Cyber Security field such as penetration testers, security anaylsts, and incident responders. Security anaylsts monitors the organizations systems and detect if there is an attack. An incident responder will figure out how the attack happened.
