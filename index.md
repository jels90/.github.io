There are many different types of malware that we should be aware of and know how to protect ourselves against. It could take one incorrect click on a website and your whole computer could be infected. A general rule of thumb is to have an updated virus and threat protection program on your computer that should protect you but sometimes that may not be enough. There are many tell-tale signs that can alert you to a potentially dangerous website or file. To fully understand what you can do as a user, first you will need to know about the many different types of malware and how they can infect our computers and even steal our personal information. 
	The most common malware that everyone has heard about is viruses. A virus is a type of program that can replicate itself by changing other computer programs and putting in its own code. The main ways a virus can spread is by opening attachments from unknown emails, downloading software from malicious sites and malicious online ads also known as malvertising. A computer virus requires a host program and a user action to help transmit from one system to another. The first computer virus (named “Brain”) was created in 1986 by two brothers named Basit and Amjad Farooq Alvi. “Brain” was created to protect software that they created and would infect computers that had illegal copies of their software. A message would appear on the infected computer to contact the brothers immediately. Nowadays, the brothers own Brain NET, Pakistan’s largest internet service provider. 
	We have come a long way since then and many more viruses have popped up since. One of the most disastrous viruses in computer history is called “Klez” and first appeared in 2001. Klez was written in C++ and most common anti-virus software programs could not detect it. It would send itself to random addresses from a person’s Outlook address book. The emails would arrive with different subject lines which made the virus even more successful. Another devastating virus happened in 2000 known as “ILOVEYOU”. Windows users would receive emails with the subject line “I love you”. Within only 10 days, 45 million computers were infected. The code was designed to steal users’ passwords and then send copies of themselves to all the contacts in the victims Outlook address book. 
	There are different types of viruses such as a Trojans and ransomware. A Trojan pretends to be something it’s not to sneak onto your computer and give you malware. When a virus disguises itself, then it’s considered a Trojan. A Trojan can be an innocent looking file you got off the web but could contain a virus. It’s best to always make sure you download files from reputable websites. Ransomware uses asymmetric encryption to hold a victim’s information at ransom. The user is unable to access their files and applications unless they pay a ransom. Ransomware is usually carried out by using a Trojan disguised as a file that the user will download and open. The first known Ransomware attack was in 1989 called the AIDS Trojan (aka PC Cyborg). A biologist named Joseph Popp distributed thousands of floppy disks during a conference in Stockholm known as the World Health Organization AIDS conference. The floppy disks contained a trojan virus that infected MS-DOS systems. Once the infected computer booted up 90 times, the virus would hide all directories and encrypted filenames. A message would appear on screen and would demand users to mail $189 dollars to a PO box in Panama. The message said it was from “PC Cyborg Corporation”. 
	Not all malware is super dangerous but can be extremely annoying. An example of this is called Adware. Adware began around in 1995 and is a software that gets money for its developer by automatically creating online advertisements in the user interface of the software or on a screen during the installation process. The software can generate two types of revenue: “pay-per-click” and simply viewing the advertisement. Some ads can also act as spyware and will collect and report data about the user. The best way to avoid adware is to be careful when installing new software on your computer and make sure to uncheck any boxes asking you to install additional services and keep away from clicking on advertisement boxes to avoid potential spyware. 
	Spyware was first recorded in 1995 and is classified into different types: adware, system monitors, tracking, trojans, rootkits, and keyloggers. Spyware is mostly used for stealing information and storing user information on the web. The presence of spyware is typically hidden and can be difficult to detect. It can collect almost any type of data such as personal information (including bank info), internet surfing habits and user logins. It can also interfere with a user’s control by installing extra software and redirecting web browsers as well as change computer settings which can result in slower internet speeds and changes to browser settings. 
	The malware Spyware can be included with legitimate software or from a malicious website. Because Spyware has been more active, anti-spyware software has been created. Unlike a virus, Spyware does not try to copy or transmit software to other computers but instead installs itself on a system by tricking the user or by exploiting vulnerabilities. The majority of Spyware is installed without the user’s knowledge and generally will try to bundle itself with popular software. Another way Spyware can be installed is by using a Trojan horse. Some types of Spyware can disable firewalls and even antivirus software which allows other infections to attack the system. 
	A form of Spyware, Keyloggers can record and steal consecutive keystrokes that the user enters. It’s software that will log what you type on your keyboard and even watch you on your camera or listen on your smartphones microphone. Keyloggers can come in hardware devices and software. The hardware option can be embedded in the PC itself or plugged in secretly into the keyboard port. Software keyloggers are much easter to install as you do not need physical access. Keyloggers installed on a computer are not dangerous to your PC but is a real threat to users as they can steal sensitive data. This type of malware invades computers just like other malware. They can be installed when you click on a file attachment via email, text message or even on a website you may have thought was legitimate. Keyloggers rarely install solo and usually include other malware such as adware, ransomware, or viruses. 
	While not always obvious to users, a good anti-virus or anti-malware program can help detect and remove keyloggers. In some cases, keyloggers may create a lag with your mouse or keystrokes which can give you a heads up that something isn’t right. The best way to protect yourself against keyloggers is to keep your anti-malware programs up to date and be care about where you’re clicking and what you are downloading. 
	Another dangerous type of malware is called botnets. Botnets are a network of infected computers, called bots, that are under the control of a single party that is called a “botnet master”. Hackers will infect computers with malware that will allow them to remotely operate infected devices. The one in control, the botnet master, can command every device from one central point. A bot herder, a hacker that seeks out vulnerable computers to infect them, will use botnets to perform automated attacks such as application DDos and taking over accounts. With application DDos, botnets are deployed on web properties of online businesses which will slow down the web and mobile applications and critically impair business functions. These attacks can damage servers, applications, and database resources. Botnets can also perform account takeovers, which include credential stuffing and brute force attacks. These attackers will use stolen credentials to access accounts and still PII (personally identifiable information). 
	In many cases, it’s mostly futile and a waste of resources for a business to try to detect and block bots and botnets because bot developers can change their bots and botnets to evade security measures easily. The advanced bots of today leverage hijacked residential IP addresses and large datacenters to carry out slow attacks using many IP addresses to evade detection. 
	The last type of malware I will discuss is rootkits. Rootkits are malicious software that is bundled designed to give unauthorized access to a computer or software. They are generally hard to detect and can conceal their presence in a system. Hackers can use these rootkits to remotely access your computer to control it and steal data. Because a rootkit grants remote admin access to your OS, a rootkit can modify anything an administrator can. The attackers can hide other malware already on your system, turn off your computers security programs, steal your data, eavesdrop on you, and create a permanent backdoor which allows the hacker to come back later whenever they want. 
	The best way to avoid malware is to make sure your computer is always up to date on updates, make sure you have updated virus/malware protection on your system and only go onto websites that you can trust. There are many different types of malware and some of them are very difficult to detect. If your computer starts acting strangely, assume that it may be infected and do a scan to find the culprit.

Week 9 Lab May 21st 2022
TryHackMe Startup

In this lab, I used a few different tools to find the secret recipe and contents of text files. At the beginning, I had to use Nmap and found an anonymous FTP login. Once I had access to FTP, I found that there were a few files I could explore. After doing some recon, I was able to access the file recipe.txt which gave me my first answer. After, I used Wireshark to open a "suspicious" .pcapng file. Eventually I was able to access user.txt which gave me my flag. At the end I was able to access Lennie's home directory and view root.txt for the final flag.

Week 15 May 7th 2022
TryHackMe Investigating Windows

In this weeks TryHackMe room, I explored a little bit of Windows. I found the version and year of the machine and when the users last logged into the machine. I checked which users had admin priviledges and explored the event viewer and windows firewall. I was able to find the date the compromise took place and when the attacker assigned special priviledges to their login.

Week 13 April 23rd 2022
TryHackMe Wifi Hacking 101

In this room, I learned about SSIDs, ESSIDs, BSSIDs and the different passwords you can use for your wifi networks (such as WPA2). I used the Aircrack-ng suite on Kali Linux VM and found the different flags and commands to use. I used a wordlist "rockyou.txt" to help find the possible password in the .cap file that was given by using the BSSID.

Week 12 April 16th 2022
TryHackMe Kenobi

In this room, I used the Linux terminal to gain information about Kenobi's machine. First I used Nmap to see how many ports were open and then used the SMBclient. I had to find the version of ProFTPd and find the exploits for that verison. I found Kenobi's private key and moved it and mounted it and found the flag in the user.txt file. Eventually, I was able to gain root access in Kenobi's machine and find the flag in the root.txt file.

Week 7 March 12th 2022
Keybase Lab

After downloading Keybase for Windows, my partner and I encrypted messages and decrypted them. I sent a decrypted message to my partner and my partner sent one back. I had to download the Saltpack file and drag it into the decryption part. It gave me .txt file I was able to open in Notepad and view the message. It was pretty entertaining receiving and sending encrypted messages.

Week 6 March 5th 2022
Encryption - Crypto 101

In this TryHackMe room, I learned about symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data, while asymmetric encryption uses a separate key for encrypting and decrypting. The room also briefly went over the Modulo operator and I had to use Python to find the answer. Another cool thing we went over was certificates and had to check the certificate for the TryHackMe website.

Week 5 Feb 25 2022
Mobile Malware Analysis

In the Mobile Malware Analysis room, I used a virtual machine to use the MOBsf tool to find information about a file. With MOBsf, I was able to see permissions, the hash, and security threats. I also used VirusTotal.com for more information about the file such as the history and type of file as well as comments from the community. With these tools, I was asked to find package names, SHA-1 signatures and name of the sample. The first file that was anaylzed was malware and the second was Pegasus.

Week 4 Feb 18 2022
WebOSINT

![Complete](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98351643/154769864-866cfb2c-562a-4ae7-a383-55d82447d992.jpg)



In this TryHackMe room, I leanred about OSINT and how to go about finding information about websites. Recommended websites included lookup.icann.org, archive.org and viewdns.info. I was able to find IP addresses, nameservers, and overall history of the website. 














Week 3  Feb 11 2022

![TryHackMe Common Attacks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98351643/153657413-79e37be1-0869-4656-a7df-0dd1fe08bfc1.jpg)


In this weeks TryHackMe room (Common Attacks), I went over many different ways our data can be stolen and how are computer can be compromised. Social engineering/phishing are two big ways attackers can steal your information. If an email looks suspicious, do not click on links and do not respond with personal information. There are a few different ways to tell if an email is a phishing scam or legit. To keep our accounts secure, it's recommended to use a password manager. Reusing the same password for multiple accounts, makes your accounts more vulnerable to attacks. It's best to have long and nonsensical passwords. You should not be able to memorize all your passwords. To keep your computer safe make sure your PC is up to date on patches and anit virus software. 

















Week 2

![TryHackMe1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98351643/152192919-b8d41be4-116b-47b2-9ace-75986edf770a.jpg)

For this first room on TryHackMe, I read about the basics of Cyber Security and the different career paths in the field. There are many different careers in the Cyber Security field such as penetration testers, security anaylsts, and incident responders. Security anaylsts monitors the organizations systems and detect if there is an attack. An incident responder will figure out how the attack happened.
