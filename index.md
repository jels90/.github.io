For this first room on TryHackMe, I read about the basics of Cyber Security and the different career paths in the field. There are many different careers in the Cyber Security field such as penetration testers, security anaylsts, and incident responders. Security anaylsts monitors the organizations systems and detect if there is an attack. An incident responder will figure out how the attack happened.
